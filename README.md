![Loan Prediction Model](images/image.png)

## üìå Problem Statement:
Predict whether a loan applicant will get loan approval (Yes or No) based on various financial and personal details such as income, credit history, employment status, etc.

## Approach:
To solve this problem, I used the **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm. For a detailed analysis and intuition behind using this algorithm, please watch the video that explains the problem statement and the rationale for selecting this algorithm.

- CoapplicantIncome ‚Äì Monthly income of co-applicant
- LoanAmount ‚Äì Loan amount applied for
- Loan_Amount_Term ‚Äì Term of the loan in months
- Credit_History ‚Äì Whether the applicant has a history of repaying loans
- Property_Area ‚Äì Urban/Rural/Semi-Urban
- Loan_Status ‚Äì Target Variable (Y/N) (Loan Approved or Not)

## Instructions to Run the Loan Approval Model App
There are two ways to run the loan approval prediction app. Follow one of the methods below:

### Method 1: Git Clone & Run Locally
1. Clone the Git repository:
- First, clone the repository containing the code.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekanand-02/Loan_Approval_Predictor.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Loan_Prediction
```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
- If you don't have venv installed, you can install it using the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
- Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment: On Linux/macOS:
```bash 
source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```bash 
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. Install the required dependencies:

- Install the dependencies specified in requirements.txt:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the application:

- Start the application using the following command:
```bash 
python app.py
```
- The app will now be running at http://localhost:5000

### Method 2: Using Docker
- If you prefer to run the app using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Install Docker if it is not pre-installed:
```bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

2. Pull the Docker image:

- After Docker is installed, pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub by running the following command:
```bash
sudo docker pull abhishekanand02/loan_aprroval_model:v1.0
```

3. Run the docker container:
- Once the image is downloaded, run the app in a Docker container:
```bash
sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 abhishekanand02/loan_aprroval_model:v1.0
```
- This will expose the app on port 5000. You can now access it via http://localhost:5000.




4. Finally, Command to stop & Remove the container:
```bash
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker stop <container-id>
sudo docker rm <container-id>
```
